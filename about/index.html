   <br>
        She currently pursuing Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. She first ventured into digital art to develop graphic works and images using Photoshop and Illustrator while I was in Vietnam. Her education in digital art was informal and self-taught. She learned basic concepts and techniques about digital art and how to use these software by myself, but she did not have a strong foundation built on theory and history. Therefore, once she got to the US a few years ago, she really wanted to expand my horizon and deepen her perspective in digital art by going to Diablo Valley College and then transferring to SJSU where she could learn and soak up knowledge.

  She chose to pursue digital media at SJSU because I want to explore deeper into the digital world to experiment and create works using digital tools rather than just digital images. She would like to explore video art, audio, and interactive installation. Her exploration of bright colors and patterns are a reflection of everyday life that is filled with happiness and sadness, routine and variety, and order and chaos.
