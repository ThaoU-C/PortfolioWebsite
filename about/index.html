        Hi, I am Thao Uyen Chau, and I am pursuing Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. I first ventured into digital art to develop graphic works and images using Photoshop and Illustrator while I was in Vietnam. My education in digital art was informal and self-taught. I learned basic concepts and techniques about digital art and how to use these software by myself, but I did not have a strong foundation built on theory and history. Therefore, once I got to the US a few years ago, I really wanted to expand my horizon and deepen my perspective in digital art by going to Diablo Valley College and then transferring to SJSU where I could learn and soak up knowledge.

  I chose to pursue digital media at SJSU because I want to explore deeper into the digital world to experiment and create works using digital tools rather than just digital images. I have not dived deep into the field yet since I just got started. However, I would like to know more about video art, audio, and interactive installation. I recently feel very attractive to installation art when learning about digital media art history and experiencing a work in-person. I enjoy the experience that installation art brings to the audience. The visual images, sounds, and environment create an entirely different reality. It is no longer just digital images but a whole environment which the audience can fully immerse themselves in. I am currently so in love with Pipilotti Ristâ€™s video and installation works because the pattern, color, sound, and sometimes chaos in her works are what I am looking for in my recent works. My exploration of bright colors and patterns are a reflection of everyday life that is filled with happiness and sadness, routine and variety, and order and chaos.
