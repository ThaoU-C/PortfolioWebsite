   <h3> <i> Inner Tranquility, </i> single screen video, 2022</h3>
   <p>
   The video shows the beauty and serenity of common activities and objects. The scenes and audios aim to help the audience feel calm and relax to connect with their inner soul.
Through this project, I continue to explore another side of familiar objects and activities, which I interact with every day when going out. I investigate things through different perspectives, using closeups or panoramas to find their exquisiteness. In terms of techniques, I explore blending, masking, filters, mixing audios, and timing audios and scenes to achieve the best outcome. The final project is a well-finished work compared to my previous videos, which were also related to nature and objects. I often pay more attention to transitions, colors, and camera motions in my works, but for the final, I also pushed myself to enhance the audio aspect. I spent a lot of time choosing audio and mixing it accordingly to match the visual aesthetics. My concept and editing techniques have expanded greatly during the final project. I am more considerate and confident about recording footages. My editing skills is also more proficient compared to the beginning of the class, which allows me to dream of working on bigger projects. For future projects, I would love to continue to explore the same theme which is about mundane activities.
