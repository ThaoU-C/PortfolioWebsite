    <h3> <i>Giant Yellow Head,</i> Glitch Art from Paper Collage, 2020</h3>
    <p>I love working with patterns, colors, and shapes. This artwork is created to demonstrate the interaction of vivid colors,
unique shapes, and strange patterns in a surreal composition. The original artwork is a paper cutout and composed into
a digital collage in my Digital Imaging for the Artist class. Audacity is used to glitch the collage to create chaotic
​distortion and decomposition of the paper cutouts' original patterns and forms.</p>
