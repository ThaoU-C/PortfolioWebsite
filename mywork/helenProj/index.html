    <h3>Bi and Helen (Walking the Dog NFT)</h3>
    <p>This work was created as an NFT from a picture taken when Bi took Helen for a walk. Dog ownership in the US
      carries an attractive aura that speaks beyond just having a pet. Walking a dog through the neighborhood
      enhances the owner's image as friendly, active, responsible, and stable.
      â€‹The artwork was painted in Photoshop to demonstrate the perception of the dog-owner relationship. </p>
